    "The problem of classifying points using concentric circles in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ can be thought of as a one-dimensional problem. This is because the classification depends only on the distance of a point from the origin, not on its angle or direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"intervals\" are the regions between the two circles, and the boundaries of these intervals are determined by the radii of the circles (R1 and R2). Just like in a one-dimensional interval, the classification of a point depends only on whether its distance from the origin falls within the interval defined by R1 and R2.\n",

    "The hypothesis space $H$ of this learning model consists of dichotomies that can shatter any set of $N$ points arranged on a circle in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The number of such dichotomies is $\\binom{N+1}{2} + 1$. Hence, the growth function $m_H(N)$ is $\\binom{N+1}{2} + 1$.\n",
